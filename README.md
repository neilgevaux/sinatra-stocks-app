## README

This is an in-progress Sinatra app to retrieve data from the Stockquote API.

The main point was to get Sinatra talking to ActiveRecord to persist data. I've been having fun with Sinatra lately, it's a great lightweight alternative to Rails. I think I've found a decent folder structure which I should probably commit seperately. The API should hook up through form input.

* Ruby version 2.7.4

* SQLlite development database (probably not going to deploy it so no need for Postgres at this stage)

* Stockquote gem
